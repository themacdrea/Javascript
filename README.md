# "The Relationship Between Zodiac Signs and Divorce."

## Introduction 

### Project Goals

This project utilizes Mexican data from Kaggle to analyze various aspects of divorce. 
By investigating the relationship between zodiac signs and divorce, identifying zodiac signs with the highest divorce rates, exploring specific zodiac sign combinations, assessing the correlation between the number of children and divorce, determining the duration of marriages, examining specific months with higher divorce rates, evaluating the influence of income brackets on divorce, and comparing one-income and two-income households, the aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of divorce patterns and the potential factors associated with divorce rates.

### What are Zodiac Signs

Zodiac signs, also known as astrological signs, are twelve distinct segments of the celestial belt that the sun, moon, and planets appear to move through in the sky over a year. These signs are traditionally associated with specific dates and are believed to influence personality traits and characteristics of individuals born under them. 
The twelve signs are:
Aries 
Taurus
Gemini
Cancer
Leo
Virgo
Libra
Scorpio
Sagittarius
Capricorn
Aquarius
Pisces. 
Astrologers use the positions of these signs at a person's birth to create their birth chart. This is thought to provide insights into their personality, behavior, relationships, and even potential life events.

## Study

### Top Male Signs
By conducting a thorough analysis, we have examined the three zodiac signs that show the highest correlation with divorce rates among both males and females.

### Males
Rank	Zodiac Sign
1	    Scorpio
2	    Sagittarius
3	    Pisces

### Females
Rank	Zodiac Sign
1	    Pisces
2	    Virgo
3	    Libra

In our research, we have created a comprehensive heat chart that explores the intriguing dynamics between males and females of each zodiac sign.

### Income

Along with exploring the relationship between zodiac signs and divorce, we examined the influence of income on marriage outcomes. In order to categorize income, we assigned it to four categories:

- Poor: Earning less than 600 USD a month.
- Lower-middle Class: Earning between 600 to 900 USD a month.
- Upper-middle Class: Earning between 900 to 1200 USD a month.
- Wealthy: Earning greater than 1200 USD a month.

For males, the income distribution was as follows:

71.7% fell into the poor category.
14.4% belonged to the lower-middle class.
5.7% were classified as upper-middle class.
5.7% were considered wealthy.

On the other hand, females had the following income distribution:

77.8% were in the poor category.
13.7% fell into the lower-middle class.
4.2% were part of the upper-middle class.
4.3% were classified as wealthy.

Understanding how income distribution correlates with divorce rates provides valuable insights into economic factors' role in marriage stability. As a result, we gain a better understanding of how socioeconomic factors affect relationships and a more comprehensive understanding of marriage dynamics.

### Family Size and Divorce Rates

The data revealed that couples with 1 child have the highest divorce rate, while couples with 3 to 7 children have the lowest divorce rate. This is indeed a remarkable finding. However, it's imperative to interpret this information with care and consider other factors that might contribute to these patterns.

###  Divorce Count and Number of Years Married 

The divorce rate decreases significantly after the first decade of marriage. Couples who overcome the challenges of the early years may find greater stability and satisfaction in their relationship. Shared experiences, such as raising children and building a life together, contribute to a stronger sense of unity and resilience.

## Conclusion 

Divorce may not be predicted by zodiac signs, but our research reveals some interesting patterns:

- Divorce rates seem to be higher for certain zodiac sign pairings.
- Divorce rates are also influenced by family size and income bracket.

By gaining insight into these factors, individuals and couples can make more informed decisions and build healthier relationships. Effective communication, empathy, and emotional intelligence are essential for navigating challenges in any marriage or partnership.
